# Preliminaries

## Approach and target audience

The material was prepared for the graduate class *Theoretical Community Ecology* taught at the University of Chicago --- AY 2020/2021. Following the material requires some familiarity with calculus (multivariable integration, derivatives, chain rule) and linear algebra (vector spaces, eigenvalues, eigenvectors). Also, a good working knowledge of `R` (functions, packages `deSolve` and `tidyverse`) is needed to follow the code.

The approach taken throughout the course is to alternate between code/simulations and mathematical derivations. While several theorems are (informally) stated, proofs are included only when elementary and/or informative of the underlying biological processes.

The class builds upon material typically presented in classes on population, community and theoretical ecology.

## Topics

Focus on continuous time, time-invariant models

Multispecies dynamics

Metapopulations

Evolutionary Game Theory

Models for Infectious Diseases

## Notation

Unless specified or for obvious exceptions, Greek letters stand for scalars (i.e., real or complex numbers), lower case roman letters for vectors, and capital roman letters for matrices (as such $a_i$ or $A_{ij}$ are scalars). We typically work in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space), $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ (i.e., the positive orthant of $\mathbb{R}^n$), or $\mathbb{R}^n_{0+}$ (non-negative orthant).  $D(x)$ is a diagonal matrix with $x$ on the diagonal, sometimes written $D(x) = X$. The matrix $A^T$ is the transpose of $A$. Whenever it is clear what I mean, I will drop the dependency on time of certain variables. 

The Generalized Lotka-Volterra model:

$$
\dfrac{d x_i(t)}{d t} = x_i(t) \left(a_i + \sum_{j} B_{ij} x_j(t) \right)
$$

can be written in compact form as:

$$
\dfrac{d x}{d t} = X (a + B x)
$$
