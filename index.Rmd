# Preliminaries {-}

## Approach and target audience {-}

The material was prepared for the graduate class *Theoretical Community Ecology* taught at the University of Chicago --- AY 2020/2021. Following the material requires some familiarity with calculus (multivariable integration, derivatives, chain rule) and linear algebra (vector spaces, eigenvalues, eigenvectors). Also, a good working knowledge of `R` (writing functions, working with the packages `deSolve` and `tidyverse`) is needed to follow the code.

The approach taken throughout the course is to alternate between code/simulations and mathematical derivations. While several theorems are (informally) stated, proofs are included only when elementary and/or informative of the underlying biological processes.

The class builds upon material typically presented in classes on population, community and theoretical ecology.

## Topics {-}

Focus on continuous time, time-invariant models

Multispecies dynamics

Metapopulations

Evolutionary Game Theory

Models for Infectious Diseases

## Notation {-}

Unless specified or for obvious exceptions, Greek letters stand for scalars (i.e., real or complex numbers), lower case roman letters for vectors, and capital roman letters for matrices (as such $a_i$ or $A_{ij}$ are scalars). We typically work in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space), $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ (i.e., the positive orthant of $\mathbb{R}^n$), or $\mathbb{R}^n_{0+}$ (non-negative orthant).  $D(x)$ is a diagonal matrix with $x$ on the diagonal, sometimes written $D(x) = X$. The matrix $A^T$ is the transpose of $A$. Whenever it is clear what I mean, I will drop the dependency on time of certain variables. 

The Generalized Lotka-Volterra model:

$$
\dfrac{d x_i(t)}{d t} = x_i(t) \left(a_i + \sum_{j} B_{ij} x_j(t) \right)
$$

can be written in compact form as:

$$
\dfrac{d x}{d t} = X (a + B x)
$$

## Grading and code of conduct {-}

Students should follow the rules and regulations set out by [University policy](https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/academic-policies/). I am expecting all students to a) participate in all classes (please contact me if you are going to be absent); b) actively contribute to discussions and lectures; c) be punctual (both for class and when submitting the homework); d) be professional and honest (no copying/cheating/plagiarizing).

### Homework (80%) {-}

Each of the lectures contains exercises that should be completed as graded homework. The homework should be submitted through Canvas as one or more `pdf` files obtained by compiling `Rmd` files. The homework should contain the derivations (you can use `LaTex` to typeset mathematics within `Rmd`, see [here](https://rpruim.github.io/s341/S19/from-class/MathinRmd.html) for commonly used commands), and code. The code must run and be correct to get a passing grade.

### Review (20%) {-}

The remaining 20% of the grade is based on a graded review. Each student should choose an interesting (important, provocative, etc.) published paper or preprint in theoretical community ecology, and produce a review (of the kind one would submit to a journal if solicited for comments). The review must contain two sections: a) Comments to the Authors, and b) Recommendation for the Editor. Good advice on writing reviews can be found [here](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/advice-how-to-review-a-manuscript-for-a-journal/).

## Sources {-}

Many excellent books are available on these topics. Here are the main references I've used in preparing these lectures:

- @strogatz2018nonlinear --- a clear, concise introduction to dynamical systems.
- @ellner2011dynamic --- an introduction to dynamical models focusing on biology.
- @hofbauer1998evolutionary --- a great resource for models of population dynamics and evolutionary game theory.
- @szederkenyi2018analysis --- an introduction to quasi-polynomial systems and reaction networks.
- @hadeler2017topics --- a more mathematically-focused reading.
- @hirsch2012differential --- an extensive, clearly written and rigorous introduction to dynamical systems.


## Acknowledgements {-}

These lectures grew out of a set of four lectures I have presented at the ICTP-SAIFR/IFT-UNESP ["School on Community Ecology: from patterns to principles"](https://www.ictp-saifr.org/community-ecology-from-patterns-to-principles/), held on January 20-25, 2020 in São Paulo, Brazil. Thanks to the organizers (Marcus Aguiar, Jacopo Grilli, Roberto Kraenkel, Ricardo Martinez-Garcia and Paulo Inácio Prado) for the invitation and for prompting me to start working on the material. I am grateful to the students for useful feedback.
